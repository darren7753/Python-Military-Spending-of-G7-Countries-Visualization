Hi, there! I created a dashboard to visualize a comparison of military spending of G7 countries throughout the years. This dashboard was created mainly using Panel and hvPlot. This was my first time using those libraries, so this dashboard is far from perfect. I'll try to improve and make it better as the time goes on. If anyone feels the need to give me advice or constructive criticism, feel free to do so.

### Built With
- [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/)
- [hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/user_guide/Introduction.html)

### Launch the Dashboard
To launch the dashboard locally on your computer, open up a terminal window and type the command below:
<br>
```
panel serve --show files_name.ipynb
```
